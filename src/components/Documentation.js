                                                <p>WorkAsPro is a platform for freelancing that uses Escrow to make sure the payment is safe. By acting as a neutral third party to receive, safely store, and only release funds upon the mutual satisfaction of the Buyer and the Seller, Escrow services help to mitigate the possibility of fraud. This article will go over escrow payment and how it works with WorkAsPro.</p>
                                                <h3>What is an <span className='orange_color'>Escrow</span>? </h3>
                                                <p className='mb-0'>Escrow is a system in which a third party is appointed to temporarily hold the assets in question during the course of a transaction. The payment is put in escrow until all the terms of the order have been met. Escrow provides an extra layer of protection in freelance transactions.</p>
                                                <p>In a freelance transaction, escrow is used to make sure both parties fulfill their obligations. It plays a role analogous to that of an intermediary in the deal. According to its terms, the payment transfer is not complete until all of the transaction's conditions have been met. Simply put, Escrow will hold the patent until the buyer is completely satisfied with the seller's work.</p>
                                                <h3>How Does <span className='orange_color'>Escrow Payment</span> Work?</h3>
                                                <p className='mb-0'>When you make a deal to buy or sell something, you're promising to stick to certain conditions. For instance, both parties are obligated to fulfil their respective ends of the bargain, with the purchaser paying the agreed-upon price by a certain time and the Seller delivering the promised project.</p>
                                                <p className='mb-0'>For cases where the terms of a contract are ambiguous, such as in the case of freelancing, and one party is worried that the other will not fulfill their obligations, a "referee" is necessary. Escrow plays the role of arbitrator, making sure both parties follow through on their commitments. The following are the steps for how Escrow works in WorkAsPro:</p>
                                                <li>Seller & Buyer accepts the terms of the project</li>
                                                <li>Project’s transaction details added to Escrow</li>
                                                <li>Buyer pays Seller’s payment on Escrow</li>
                                                <li>Escrow verifies the payment of the Buyer and notifies that funds are secured</li>
                                                <li>Seller completes the order of Buyer</li>
                                                <li>The Buyer is satisfied with the order and accepts it</li>
                                                <li>Escrow releases the payment to Seller</li>
                                                <li className='pb-3'>Escrow releases the payment to Seller once all parties are satisfied</li>
                                                <h3><span className='orange_color'>Escrow Payment</span> in WorkAsPro</h3>
                                                <p className='mb-0'>To help both Sellers and Buyers, we use the Escrow Payment method. It is a safe and protected method that will help to build strong working relationships without worrying freelancers about payment. As a third party, Escrow acts as a safe place to store money agreed upon in a fixed-price contract with a freelancer. Your payment will be held in escrow until the freelancer or Seller has completed their work to Buyer’s satisfaction.</p>
                                                <p className='mb-0'>If you're hiring Seller for a fixed price, you can use WorkAsPro to hold their payment in Escrow until Seller completes the job and you're satisfied with it. You, as a Buyer, can rest easy knowing that you won't have to hand over payment until you're completely satisfied with the work, while the Sellers can rest easy knowing that they'll get paid when they're due it.</p>
                                                <p className=''>You will have 14 days to either approve the Seller’s work as is or request revisions. If no action is taken within 14 days, it will be assumed that the escrow agreement is approved and the funds will be released. If you want your WorkAsPro Seller to revise their current submission, make sure to select Request Changes on the contract. In the event of a problem, please reach WorkAsPro Support to report an issue.</p>
                                                <h3>How Does <span className='orange_color'>Escrow</span> Protect the Payment of Seller & Buyer?</h3>
                                                <p>The steps for how Escrow protects payment for both the seller and the buyer are as follows:</p>
                                                <li>Before giving the Seller the green light to order, the Buyer must ensure that all payments are in "good funds."</li>
                                                <li>Tracking numbers are assigned to each order to verify that both the Seller and the Buyer have completed their ends of the bargain.</li>
                                                <li className='pb-3'>Before any funds are released to the Sellers, the Buyer is given the option of revision if they suspect it is counterfeit.</li>
                                                <p className='mb-0'>The balance of power between Buyers and Sellers is restored by Escrow's easy-to-use, risk-free, and safe online platform. It doesn't matter what you're selling or buying on WorkAsPro, our Escrow protects you from fraud and keeps your money safe. In case of any fraud, Buyer or Seller can contact WorkAsPro Support.

                                                <h3 className='text-black-50'>Update Buyer About Process <span className=''>Throughout the Order</span></h3>
                                                <p className='mb-0'>Once the buyer has placed an order on your Gig, now it’s your time to understand the order properly. If you have any questions regarding the project, ask without any hesitation otherwise bad rating can affect your Gig badly, and you know that. Make sure to discuss an order with a buyer and inform the buyer throughout the project.</p>
                                                <p className=''>This is the best way to complete the project. This way, you can make a positive impact on your buyer and can make him your repeat customer.</p>
                                                <h3 className='text-black-50'>Deliver <span className=''>High-Quality</span> Work On Time</h3>
                                                <p className='mb-0'>Now we come to the most important part of the order. Make sure that you deliver your order that fulfills buyer requirements. Provide your buyer with high-standard work and ask if he/she is satisfied with your work.</p>
                                                <p className=''>Another important thing is timing. You know, “Time is Money.” Don’t forget to deliver orders on time, as it will make a positive impact and can save you from bad reviews. In case you’re running out of time, and need some extra time to complete the order, ask your buyer for a due date extension. Also, don’t provide your buyer with poor-quality work just to meet the deadline. You can ask for extra time, but you may not find an excuse for poor-quality work.</p>                                               </div>
